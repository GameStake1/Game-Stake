Staking
{% endhint %}

* [x] Staking offers cryptocurrency investors a way to put their digital assets to work and earn passive income without having to sell them.
* [x] It's like putting money into a savings account, but with a high yield. That's because when you deposit an amount in a savings account, the bank takes that money and usually lends it to other people. In return you get interest earned on the loans - albeit a very, very low percentage.
* [x] Similarly, when you staking your digital assets, you "blockchain" the coins to participate in the execution of the blockchain and contribute to its security.
