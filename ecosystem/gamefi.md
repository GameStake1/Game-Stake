# â–ª GameFi

{% hint style="warning" %}
GameFi
{% endhint %}

We will have GameFi concepts applied to Game Stake, where our economy is totally focused on our future NFT's allowing for negotiations of sales and purchases of rarities. We will address concepts of virtual monetization through construction and evolution of avatars, but also keep rewards through completed tasks. In the[play-to-earn.md](play-to-earn.md "mention") we will have more practical examples of our application.
