# â–ª Launchpad

{% hint style="warning" %}
Launchpad
{% endhint %}

This platform works for those who want to buy tokens for new projects and for those who want to launch their own project. But, developers will have to pass a rigorous review to determine if the project passes the standards set by Game Stake**.**

The projects must

* Have their development at a relatively mature stage
* Be ready for large-scale adoption
* Have a strong and committed team
* Show potential to benefit the growth and development of the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem

After the selection process, the project is presented on Launchpad, where all Game Stake users can start trading the token.

**Capture, negotiation and launch of new projects in the e-Sports and Metaverse segment.**
