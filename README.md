# ðŸŒª Game Stake

If you were born before 2010, do you imagine that in the future we would have digital currencies that would not belong to any country? Or, who knows, that nations themselves would study about releasing versions of their sovereign money in a completely virtual way? This is crypto technology, which is beginning to build our present and shape our future.

We know that the cryptocurrency universe is not something new: Bitcoin, which started this evolution, was created in 2008, that is, 14 years ago. With almost a decade and a half of history, digital currencies have been responsible for a series of transformations inside and outside the blockchains that are now part of our daily lives.
