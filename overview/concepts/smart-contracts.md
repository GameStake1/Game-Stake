#### Smart contracts
{% endhint %}

Now let's talk about smart contracts. These are, in short, the same as physical contracts, but programmed in a programming language and without the mediation of a third party.

In other words, you no longer need to go to a notary's office to create a contract. For this, you only need to write this document on the blockchain. Both parties to the agreement must then follow the prescribed requirements.

To put the contract into practice, you also don't need a third person, as the blockchain itself will play this role. It is worth remembering that the agreement will only be made if both parties are in agreement and will be executed automatically, hence the name "smart contracts."
