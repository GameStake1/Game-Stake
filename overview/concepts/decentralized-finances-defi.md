Decentralized Finances (DeFi)
{% endhint %}

Decentralized Finance (DeFi) is the automatic evolution of cryptocurrencies. Through them, you are able to make loans, financing, and other contracts in a fully digital and secure manner through blockchains.

DeFi use smart contracts to function. Basically, they work like the products found in banks. However, you do not need a financial institution to perform them.

The main blockchain to make DeFi is Ethereum.
