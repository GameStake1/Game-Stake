Tokenization
{% endhint %}

Did you know that the Central Bank of Brazil is studying to create the Digital Real? The currency would have the same value as the physical Real, but would function as a cryptocurrency.

One of the main functionalities of the Digital Real, according to the Central Bank itself, would be the tokenization of assets. That is, you could transform your house and car, for example, into tokens, which would be registered in the blockchain.

This would facilitate the creation of smart contracts and more secure and efficient sales and purchases.
