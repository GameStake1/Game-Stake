Crypto technology has made the idea of a metaverse, or a "virtual universe" more and more plausible.

Basically, the metaverse would be a place where people from all over the world can connect. In this virtual environment, there are their own currencies (cryptocurrencies), artworks, land and objects.

To get even closer to this concept, the company Facebook changed its name to "Meta" in 2021. This shows that, increasingly, the world that existed only in science fiction movies is about to become real!
